# Conway's Game of Life

This is how I went about solving the CGOL. 

### Tools I Used 

* ruby 
* Sinatra
* Rspec for testing
* HAML -- don't have a preference for or against haml.  
* jQuery -- I don't mind coffee script but didn't want to add it to Sinatra app. 

### Approach 

I really did this as an example of full stack dev. So I wanted to incorporate server side data/logic ie ruby class and JQuery/HAML for visualization. I tested with a 3x3 array to test my logic and wrote rspec tests with sample behavior covering logic. I chose sinatra for light weight web server without having to mess with full rails app. I chose haml just to use it. 

### TODO

User should be able to make a rectangular board. 
User should not see the turn route in the URL.

Could make it social and allow other users to save initial game states and share them, if we wanted to get CRAZY!!!
