   # 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by needs caused by underpopulation.
   # 2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
   # 3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation.
   # 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
